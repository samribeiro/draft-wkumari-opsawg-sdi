      <t>Deploying a new network device often requires that an employee
      physically travel to a datacenter to perform the initial install and
      configuration, even in shared datacenters with "smart-hands" type
      support. In many cases, this could be avoided if there were a standard,
      secure way to initially provision the devices.</t>

      <t>This document extends existing auto-install / Zero-Touch Provisioning
      mechanisms to make the process more secure.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In a growing, global network, significant amounts of time and money
      are spent simply deploying new devices and "forklift" upgrading existing
      devices. In many cases, these devices are in shared datacenters (for
      example, Internet Exchange Points (IXP) or "carrier neutral
      datacenters"), which have staff on hand that can be contracted to
      perform tasks including physical installs, device reboots, loading
      initial configurations, etc. There are also a number of (often vendor
      proprietary) protocols to perform initial device installs and
      configurations - for example, many network devices will attempt to use
      DHCP <xref target="RFC2131"></xref>to get an IP address and
      configuration server, and then fetch and install a configuration
      when they are first powered on.</t>

      <t>Network device configurations contain a significant amount of
      security related and / or proprietary information (for example, RADIUS
      <xref target="RFC2865"></xref> or TACACS+ <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs"/>
      secrets). Exposing these to a third party to load onto a new
      device (or using an auto-install techniques which fetch an unencrypted
      config file via something like TFTP <xref target="RFC1350"/>) is simply
      not acceptable to many
      operators, and so they have to send employees to remote locations to
      perform the initial configuration work. As well as having a significant
      monetary cost, it also takes significantly longer to install devices and
      is generally inefficient.</t>

      <t>There are some workarounds to this, such as asking the vendor to
      pre-configure the devices before shipping it; asking the smart-hands to
      install a terminal server; providing a minimal, unsecured configuration
      and using that to bootstrap to a complete configuration, etc; but these
      are often clumsy and have security issues - for example, in the terminal
      server case, the console port connection could be easily snooped.</t>

      <t>This document layers security onto existing auto-install solutions to
      provide a secure method to initially configure new devices. It is
      optimized for simplicity, both for the implementor and the operator; it
      is explicitly not intended to be an "all singing, all dancing" fully
      featured system for managing installed / deployed devices, nor is it
      intended to solve all use-cases - rather it is a simple targeted
      solution to solve a common operational issue. Solutions such as <xref
      target="RFC8572">Secure Zero Touch Provisioning (SZTP)"</xref>,
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/> and similar are much
      more fully featured, but also more complex to implement and / or are not
      widely deployed yet.</t>

      <t>This solution is specifically designed to be a simple method on top
      of exiting device functionality. If devices do not support this new
      method, they can continue to use the existing functionality. In addition,
      operators can choose to use this to protect their configuration information,
      or can continue to use the existing functionality.</t>

      <t>The issue of securely installing devices is in no way a new issue, nor
      is it limited to network devices; it occurs when deploying servers, PCs,
      IoT devices, and in many other situations. While the solution described
      in this document is obvious (encrypt the config, then decrypt it
      with a device key), this document only discusses the use for network
      devices, such as routers and switches.</t>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>Most network devices already include some sort of initial bootstrapping
      logic (sometimes called 'autoboot', or 'autoinstall'). This generally works
      by having a newly installed / unconfigured device obtain an IP address and
      address of a config server (often called 'next-server', 'siaddr' or
      'tftp-server-name') using DHCP (see <xref target="RFC2131"></xref>). The device
      then contacts this configuration server to download its initial configuration,
      which is often identified using the devices serial number, MAC address or
      similar. This document extends this (vendor specific) paradigm by allowing
      the configuration file to be encrypted.</t>

      <t>This document describes a concept, and some example ways of implementing
      this concept. As devices have different capabilities, and use different
      configuration paradigms, one method will not suit all, and so it is
      expected that vendors will differ in exactly how they implement this.</t>

      <t>This document uses the serial number of the device as a unique
      identifier for simplicity; some vendors may not want to implement the
      system using the serial number as the identifier for business reasons (a
      competitor or similar could enumerate the serial numbers and determine
      how many devices have been manufactured). Implementors are free to
      choose some other way of generating identifiers (e.g., UUID <xref
      target="RFC4122"/>), but this will likely make it somewhat harder for
      operators to use (the serial number is usually easy to find on a device,
      a more complex system is likely harder to track).</t>

      <t>[ Ed note: This example also uses TFTP because that is what many vendors
      use in their auto-install / ZTP feature. It could easily instead be
      HTTP, FTP, etc. ]</t>

    <section title="Example Scenario">
      <t>Sirius Cybernetics Corp needs another peering router, and so they
      order another router from Acme Network Widgets, to be drop-shipped to
      the Point of Presence (POP) / datacenter. Acme begins assembling the new
      device, and tells Sirius what the new device's serial number will be
      (SN:17894321). When Acme first installs the firmware on the device and
      boots it, the device generates a public-private keypair, and Acme
      publishes it on their keyserver (in a public key certificate, for
      ease of use).</t>

      <t>While the device is being shipped, Sirius generates the initial
      device configuration, fetches the certificate from Acme keyservers by
      providing the serial number of the new device. Sirius then encrypts the
      device configuration and puts this encrypted config on a (local) TFTP
      server.</t>

      <t>When the device arrives at the POP, it gets installed in Sirius'
      rack, and cabled as instructed. The new device powers up and discovers
      that it has not yet been configured. It enters its autoboot state, and
      begins the DHCP process. Sirius' DHCP server provides it with an IP
      address and the address of the configuration server. The router uses
      TFTP to fetch its config file (note that all this is existing
      functionality). The device attempts to load the config file - if the
      config file is unparsable, (new functionality) the device tries to use
      its private key to decrypt the file, and, assuming it validates,
      installs the new configuration.</t>

      <t>Only the "correct" device will have the required private key and be
      able to decrypt and use the config file (See Security Considerations).
      An attacker would be able to connect to the network and get an IP
      address. They would also be able to retrieve (encrypted) config files by
      guessing serial numbers (or perhaps the server would allow directory
      listing), but without the private keys an attacker will not be able to
      decrypt the files.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Vendor Role / Requirements ">
      <t>This section describes the vendors roles and responsibilities and
      provides an overview of what the device needs to do.</t>

      <section title="Device key generation">
        <t>Each devices requires a public-private key keypair, and for the
        public part to be published and retrievable by the operator. The
        cryptograthic algorithm and keylenghts to be used are out of the scope
        of this document. This section illustrates one method, but, as with
        much of this document the exact mechanism may will vary by vendor.
        <xref target="I-D.gutmann-scep"/> is one method which vendors may
        want to strongly consider.</t>

        <t>During the manufacturing stage, when the device is initially powered
        on, it will generate a public-private keypair. It will send its unique
        identifier and the public key to the vendor's Certificate Publication
        Server to be published. The vendor's Certificate Publication
        Server should only accept certificates from the manufacturing facility,
        and which match vendor defined policies (for example, extended key usage,
        extensions, etc.) Note that some devices may be constrained, and so may send
        the raw public key and unique identifier to the certificate
        publication server, while more capable devices may generate and send
        self-signed certificates.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Certificate Publication Server">
        <t>The certificate publication server contains a database of
        certificates. If newly manufactured devices upload certificates the
        certificate publication server can simply publish these, if the
        devices provide raw public keys and unique identifiers the certificate
        publication server will need to wrap these in a certificate. Note that
        the certificate publication server MUST only accept certificates or keys
        from the vendor's manufacturing facilities.</t>

        <t>The customers (e.g., Sirius Cybernetics Corp) query this server with
        the serial number (or other provided unique identifier) of a device,
        and retrieve the associated certificate. It is expected that operators
        will receive the unique identifier (serial number) of devices when
        they purchase them, and will download and store / cache the
        certificate. This means that there is not a hard requirement on the
        uptime / reachability of the certificate publication server.</t>

      <section anchor="initial_cust_boot" title="Example Initial Customer Boot">
        <t>When the device is first booted by the customer (and on subsequent
        boots), if the device does not have a valid configuration, it will use
        existing auto-install functionality. As an example, it performs DHCP
        Discovery until it gets a DHCP offer including DHCP option 66
        (Server-Name) or 150 (TFTP server address), contact the server
        listed in these DHCP options and downloads its config file. Note that this
        is existing functionality (for example, Cisco devices fetch the config
        file named by the Bootfile-Name DHCP option (67)).</t>

        <t>After retrieving the config file, the device needs to determine if it is
        encrypted or not. If it is not encrypted, the existing behavior is used.
        If the configuration is encrypted, the process continues as described in this
        document. The method used to determine if the config is encrypted or not is
        implementation dependant; there are a number of (obvious) options, including
        having a magic string in the file header, using a file name extension
        (e.g., config.enc), or using specific DHCP options.</t>

        <t>If the file is encrypted, the device will attempt to
        decrypt and parse the file. It able, it will install the configuration, and
        start using it. If this fails, the device with either abort the auto-install
        process, or will repeat this process until it succeeds.</t>

        <t>Note that the device only needs to be able to download the
        config file; after the initial power-on in the factory it never needs
        to access the Internet or vendor or certificate publication server - it
        (and only it) has the private key and so has the ability to decrypt
        the config file.</t>

    <section title="Additional Considerations">
      <section title="Key storage">
        <t>Ideally, the keypair would be stored in a Trusted Platform Module
        (TPM) on something which is identified as the &ldquo;router&rdquo;
        - for example, the chassis / backplane. This is so that a keypair
        is bound to what humans think of as the &ldquo;device&rdquo;, and
        not, for example (redundant) routing engines. Devices which
        implement IEEE 802.1AR <xref target="IEEE802-1AR"/>
        could choose to use the IDevID for this
        purpose.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Key replacement ">
        <t>It is anticipated that some operator may want to replace the
        (vendor provided) keys after installing the device. There are two
        options when implementing this - a vendor could allow the operator's
        key to completely replace the initial device generated key (which
        means that, if the device is ever sold, the new owner couldn't use
        this technique to install the device), or the device could prefer the
        operators installed key. This is an implementation decision left to
        the vendor.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Device reinstall">
        <t>Increasingly, operations is moving towards an automated model of
        device management, whereby portions (or the entire) configuration is
        programmatically generated. This means that operators may want to
        generate an entire configuration after the device has been initially
        installed and ask the device to load and use this new configuration.
        It is expected (but not defined in this document, as it is vendor
        specific) that vendors will allow the operator to copy a new,
        encrypted config (or part of a config) onto a device and then request
        that the device decrypt and install it (e.g.: &lsquo;load replace
        &lt;filename&gt; encrypted)). The operator could also choose to reset
        the device to factory defaults, and allow the device to act as though
        it were the initial boot (see <xref target="initial_cust_boot"/>).</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document makes no requests of the IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This mechanism is intended to replace either expensive (traveling
      employees) or insecure mechanisms of installing newly deployed devices
      such as: unencrypted config files which can be downloaded by connecting
      to unprotected ports in datacenters, mailing initial config files on
      flash drives, or emailing config files and asking a third-party to copy
      and paste it over a serial terminal. It does not protect against devices
      with malicious firmware, nor theft and reuse of devices.</t>

      <t>An attacker (e.g., a malicious datacenter employee) who has physical
      access to the device before it is connected to the network the attacker
      may be able to extract the device private key (especially if it isn't
      stored in a TPM), pretend to be the device when connecting to the
      network, and download and extract the (encrypted) config file.</t>

      <t>This mechanism does not protect against a malicious vendor - while
      the keypair should be generated on the device, and the private key
      should be securely stored, the mechanism cannot detect or protect
      against a vendor who claims to do this, but instead generates the
      keypair off device and keeps a copy of the private key. It is largely
      understood in the operator community that a malicious vendor or attacker
      with physical access to the device is largely a "Game Over"
      situation.</t>

      <t>Even when using a secure bootstrapping mechanism, security conscious
      operators may wish to bootstrapping devices with a minimal / less
      sensitive config, and then replace this with a more complete one after
      install.</t>

      <t>From -03 to -04:</t>

      <t>Addressed a number of comments received before / at IETF104 (Prague).
      These include:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Pointer to
          https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-netconf-zerotouch --
          included reference to (now) RFC8572 (KW)</t>

          <t>Suggested that 802.1AR IDevID (or similar) could be used. Stress
          that this is designed for simplicity (MR)</t>

          <t>Added text to explain that any unique device identifier can be
          used, not just serial number - serial number is simple and easy, but
          anything which is unique (and can be communicated to the customer)
          will work (BF).</t>

          <t>Lots of clarifications from Joe Clarke.</t>

          <t>Make it clear it should first try use the config, and if it
          doesn't work, then try decrypt and use it.</t>

          <t>The CA part was confusing people - the certificate is simply a
          wrapper for the key, and the Subject just an index, and so removed
          that.</t>

    <section title="Demo / proof of concept">
      <t>This section contains a rough demo / proof of concept of the system.
      It is only intended for illustration, and is not intended to be used
      in production.</t>

      <t>It uses OpenSSL from the command line, in production something more
      automated would be used. In this example, the unique identifier is the
      serial number of the router, SN19842256.</t>

      <section title="Step 1: Generating the certificate. ">
        <t>This step is performed by the router. It generates a key, then a
        csr, and then a self signed certificate.</t>

        <t>The operator now wants to deploy the new router.</t>

        <t>They generate the initial config (using whatever magic tool

      <section title="Step 3: Decrypting and using the config. ">
        <t>When the router connects to the operator's network it will detect
        that does not have a valid configuration file, and will start the
        &ldquo;autoboot&rdquo; process. This is a well documented process, but
        the high level overview is that it will use DHCP to obtain an IP
        address and config server. It will then use TFTP to download a
        configuration file, based upon its serial number (this document
        modifies the solution to fetch an encrypted config file (ending in
        .enc)). It will then decrypt the config file, and install it.</t>
