      <t>Deploying a new network device in a location
      where the operator has no staff of its own often requires that an employee
      physically travel to the location to perform the initial install and
      configuration, even in shared facilities with "remote-hands" type
      support. In many cases, this could be avoided if there were an
      easy way to transfer the initial configuration to a new device,
      while still maintaining confidentiality of the configuration.</t>

    <t>This document extends existing vendor proprietary auto-install

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In a growing, global network, significant amounts of time and money
      are spent deploying new devices and "forklift" upgrading
      existing devices. In many cases, these devices are in shared
      facilities (for example, Internet Exchange Points (IXP) or
      "carrier-neutral datacenters"), which have staff on hand that can be
      contracted to perform tasks including physical installs, device
      reboots, loading initial configurations, etc. There are also a
      number of (often proprietary) protocols to perform initial
      device installs and configurations. For example, many network
      devices will attempt to use DHCP <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> or
      DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415"></xref> to get
      an IP address and configuration server, and then fetch and install
      a configuration when they are first powered on.</t>

      <t>The configurations of network devices contain a significant amount of
      security-related and proprietary information (for example, RADIUS
      <xref target="RFC2865"></xref> or TACACS+ <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs"/>
      secrets). Exposing these to a third party to load onto a new device (or using
      an auto-install technique which fetches an unencrypted configuration file via
      TFTP <xref target="RFC1350"/>) or something similar is an unacceptable
      security risk for many operators, and so they send employees to remote locations to
      perform the initial configuration work; this costs time and money.</t>

      <t>There are some workarounds to this, such as asking the vendor to pre-
      configure the device before shipping it; asking the remote support to
      install a terminal server; providing a minimal, unsecured
      configuration and using that to bootstrap to a complete
      configuration, etc. However, these are often clumsy and have security
      issues. As an example, in the terminal server case, the console port
      connection could be easily snooped.</t>

      <t>An ideal solution in this space would protect both the confidentiality
       of device configuration in transit and the authenticity (and authorization
       status) of configuration to be used by the device. The mechanism described
       in this document only addresses the former, and makes no effort to do
       the latter, with the device accepting any configuration file that comes its
       way and is encrypted to the device's key (or not encrypted, as the case may be).
       Other solutions (such as <xref
      target="RFC8572">"Secure Zero Touch Provisioning (SZTP)"</xref>,
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"/> and other
      voucher-based methods) are more fully featured, but also require
      more complicated machinery. This document describes something much
      simpler, at the cost of only providing limited protection.</t>

      <t>This document layers security onto existing auto-install solutions
      (one example of which is <xref target="Cisco_AutoInstall"/>)
      to provide a method to initially configure new devices while maintaining
      confidentiality of the initial configuration. It is
      optimized for simplicity, for both the implementor and the operator;
      it is explicitly not intended to be a
      fully featured system for managing installed devices, nor
      is it intended to solve all use cases: rather it is a simple
      targeted solution to solve a common operational issue where the
      network device has been delivered, fibre laid (as appropriate)
      and there is no trusted member of the operator's staff to perform
      the initial configuration. This solution is only intended to increase
      confidentiality of the information in the configuration file, and
      does not protect the device itself from loading a malicious
      configuration.</t>

      <t>This document describes a concept, and some example ways of implementing
      this concept. As devices have different capabilities, and use different
      configuration paradigms, one method will not suit all, and so it is
      expected that vendors will differ in exactly how they implement this.</t>

      <t>This solution is specifically designed to be a simple method on top
      of exiting device functionality. If devices do not support this new
      method, they can continue to use the existing functionality. In
      addition, operators can choose to use this to protect their
      configuration information, or can continue to use the existing
      functionality.</t>

      <t>The issue of securely installing devices is in no way a new issue,
      nor is it limited to network devices; it occurs when deploying
      servers, PCs, IoT devices, and in many other situations. While the
      solution described in this document is obvious (encrypt the config,
      then decrypt it with a device key), this document only discusses the
      use for network devices, such as routers and switches.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>Most network devices already include some sort of initial bootstrapping
      logic (sometimes called 'autoboot', or 'autoinstall'). This generally works
      by having a newly installed, unconfigured device obtain an IP address for itself
      and discover the address of a configuration server
      (often called 'next-server', 'siaddr' or
      'tftp-server-name') using DHCP or DHCPv6 (see <xref target="RFC2131"></xref>,
      <xref target="RFC8415"></xref>). The device
      then contacts this configuration server to download its initial configuration,
      which is often identified using the device's serial number, MAC address or
      similar. This document extends this (vendor-specific) paradigm by allowing
      the configuration file to be encrypted.</t>

      <t>This document uses the serial number of the device as a unique device
      identifier for simplicity; some vendors may not want to implement the
      system using the serial number as the identifier for business reasons (a
      competitor or similar could enumerate the serial numbers and determine
      how many devices have been manufactured). Implementors are free to
      choose some other way of generating identifiers (e.g., UUID <xref
      target="RFC4122"/>), but this will likely make it somewhat harder for
      operators to use (the serial number is usually easy to find on a device).</t>

      <t>[ Ed note: This example also uses TFTP because that is what many vendors
      use in their auto-install feature. It could easily instead be
      HTTP, FTP, etc. ]</t>

    <section title="Example Scenario">
      <t>Operator_A needs another peering router, and so they
      order another router from Vendor_B, to be drop-shipped to
      the facility. Vendor_B begins assembling the new
      device, and tells Operator_A what the new device's serial number will be
      (SN:17894321). When Vendor_B first installs the firmware on the device and
      boots it, the device generates a public-private key pair, and Vendor_B
      publishes the public key on their keyserver (in a public key certificate, for
      ease of use).</t>

      <t>While the device is being shipped, Operator_A generates the initial
      device configuration and fetches the certificate from Vendor_B keyservers by
      providing the serial number of the new device. Operator_A then encrypts the
      device configuration and puts this encrypted configuration on a (local) TFTP
      server.</t>

      <t>When the device arrives at the POP, it gets installed in Operator_A's
      rack, and cabled as instructed. The new device powers up and discovers
      that it has not yet been configured. It enters its autoboot state, and
      begins the DHCP process. Operator_A's DHCP server provides it with an IP
      address and the address of the configuration server. The router uses
      TFTP to fetch its configuration file. Note that all of this is existing
      functionality. The device attempts to load the configuration file. As an
      added step, if the configuration file cannot be parsed, the device tries
      to use its private key to decrypt the file and, assuming it validates,
      proceeds to install the new, decrypted, configuration.</t>

      <t>Only the "correct" device will have the required private key and be
      able to decrypt and use the configuration file (See
      <xref target="security">Security Considerations</xref>).
      An attacker would be able to connect to the network and get an IP
      address. They would also be able to retrieve (encrypted) configuration files by
      guessing serial numbers (or perhaps the server would allow directory
      listing), but without the private keys an attacker will not be able to
      decrypt the files.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Vendor Role">
      <t>This section describes the vendor's roles and
      provides an overview of what the device needs to do.</t>

      <section title="Device key generation">
        <t>Each device requires a public-private key pair, and for the
        public part to be published and retrievable by the operator. The
        cryptographic algorithm and key lengths to be used are out of the scope
        of this document. This section illustrates one method, but, as with
        much of this document the exact mechanism may vary by vendor.
        Enrollment over Secure Transport (<xref target="RFC7030"/>)
        or possibly <xref target="I-D.gutmann-scep"/> are
        methods which vendors may want to consider.</t>

        <t>During the manufacturing stage, when the device is initially powered
        on, it will generate a public-private key pair. It will send its unique device
        identifier and the public key to the vendor's directory server
        to be published. The vendor's directory server
        should only accept certificates from the manufacturing facility,
        and which match vendor defined policies (for example, extended key usage,
        and extensions) Note that some devices may be constrained, and so may send
        the raw public key and unique device identifier to the certificate
        publication server, while more capable devices may generate and send
        self-signed certificates. This communication with the directory server
        should be integrity protected, and in a controlled environment.</t>

        <t>This reference architecture needs a serialization format for the
        key material.  Due to the prevalence of tooling support for it on
        network devices, X.509 certificates are a convenient format to
        exchange public keys. However, most of the meta-data that would
        use for revocation and aging will not be used and should be
        ignored by both the client and server. In such  cases the
        signature on the certificate conveys no value and the consumer
        of the certificate is expected to pin the end-entity key
        fingerprint (versus using a PKI and signature chain).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Directory Server">
        <t>The directory server contains a database of
        certificates. If newly manufactured devices upload certificates the
        directory server can simply publish these; if the
        devices provide the raw public keys and unique device identifier,
        the directory server will need to wrap these in a
        certificate.</t>

        <t>The customers (e.g., Operator_A) query this server with
        the serial number (or other provided unique identifier) of a device,
        and retrieve the associated certificate. It is expected that operators
        will receive the unique device identifier (serial number) of devices when
        they purchase them, and will download and store the
        certificate. This means that there is not a hard requirement on the
        reachability of the directory server.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="initial_cust_boot" title="Example Initial Customer Boot">
        <t>When the device is first booted by the customer (and on subsequent
        boots), if the device does not have a valid configuration, it will use
        existing auto-install functionality. As an example, it performs DHCP
        Discovery until it gets a DHCP offer including DHCP option 66
        (Server-Name) or 150 (TFTP server address), contacts the server
        listed in these DHCP options and downloads its configuration file. Note that this
        is existing functionality (for example, Cisco devices fetch the config
        file named by the Bootfile-Name DHCP option (67)).</t>

        <t>After retrieving the configuration file, the device needs to determine if it is
        encrypted or not. If it is not encrypted, the existing behavior is used.
        If the configuration is encrypted, the process continues as described in this
        document. The method used to determine if the configuration is encrypted or not is
        implementation dependent; there are a number of (obvious) options, including
        having a magic string in the file header, using a file name extension
        (e.g., config.enc), or using specific DHCP options.</t>

        <t>If the file is encrypted, the device will attempt to
        decrypt and parse the file. If able, it will install the configuration, and
        start using it. If it cannot decrypt the file, or if parsing the configuration fails,
        the device will either abort the auto-install process, or repeat this
        process until it succeeds. When retrying, care should be taken to not
        overwhelm the server hosting the encrypted configuration files. It is suggested
        that the device retry every 5 minutes for the first hour, and then every hour after
        that. As it is expected that devices may be installed well before the
        configuration file is ready, a maximum number of retries is not specified.</t>

        <t>Note that the device only needs to be able to download the
        configuration file; after the initial power-on in the factory it never needs
        to access the Internet or vendor or directory server. The device
        (and only the device) has the private key and so has the ability to decrypt
        the configuration file.</t>

    <section title="Additional Considerations">
      <section title="Key storage">
        <t>Ideally, the key pair would be stored in a Trusted Platform Module
        (TPM) on something which is identified as the &ldquo;router&rdquo;
        - for example, the chassis / backplane. This is so that a key pair
        is bound to what humans think of as the &ldquo;device&rdquo;, and
        not, for example (redundant) routing engines. Devices which
        implement IEEE 802.1AR <xref target="IEEE802-1AR"/>
        could choose to use the IDevID for this
        purpose.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Key replacement ">
        <t>It is anticipated that some operator may want to replace the
        (vendor provided) keys after installing the device. There are two
        options when implementing this: a vendor could allow the operator's
        key to completely replace the initial device-generated key (which
        means that, if the device is ever sold, the new owner couldn't use
        this technique to install the device), or the device could prefer the
        operator's installed key. This is an implementation decision left to
        the vendor.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Device reinstall">
        <t>Increasingly, operations is moving towards an automated model of
        device management, whereby portions of (or the entire) configuration is
        programmatically generated. This means that operators may want to
        generate an entire configuration after the device has been initially
        installed and ask the device to load and use this new configuration.
        It is expected (but not defined in this document, as it is vendor
        specific) that vendors will allow the operator to copy a new,
        encrypted configuration (or part of a configuration) onto a device and then request
        that the device decrypt and install it (e.g.: &lsquo;load replace
        &lt;filename&gt; encrypted). The operator could also choose to reset
        the device to factory defaults, and allow the device to act as though
        it were the initial boot (see <xref target="initial_cust_boot"/>).</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document makes no requests of the IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This reference architecture is intended to incrementally improve
      upon commonly accepted "auto-install" practices used today that may
      transmit configurations unencrypted (e.g., unencrypted configuration files
      which can be downloaded connecting to unprotected ports in datacenters,
      mailing initial configuration files on flash drives, or emailing configuration files
      and asking a third-party to copy and paste them over a serial terminal)
      or allow unrestricted access to these configurations.</t>

      <t>This document describes an object level security design to provide
      confidentiality assurances for the configuration while it is in
      transit between the configuration server and the unprovisioned
      device even if the underly transport does not provide this
      security service.</t>

      <t>The architecture provides no assurances about the source of
      the encrypted configuration or protect against theft and
      reuse of devices.</t>

      <t>An attacker (e.g., a malicious datacenter employee, person in the
      supply chain, etc.) who has physical
      access to the device before it is connected to the network, or who
      manages to exploit it once installed,
      may be able to extract the device private key (especially if it is not
      stored in a TPM), pretend to be the device when connecting to the
      network, and download and extract the (encrypted) configuration file.</t>

      <t>An attacker with access to the configuration server (or the
      ability to route traffic to configuration server under their control)
      and the device's public key could return a configuration of the
      attacker's choosing to the unprovisioned device.</t>

      <t>This mechanism does not protect against a malicious vendor. While
      the key pair should be generated on the device, and the private key
      should be securely stored, the mechanism cannot detect or protect
      against a vendor who claims to do this, but instead generates the
      key pair off device and keeps a copy of the private key. It is largely
      understood in the operator community that a malicious vendor or attacker
      with physical access to the device is largely a "Game Over"
      situation.</t>

      <t>Even when using a secure bootstrap mechanism, security-conscious
      operators may wish to bootstrap devices with a minimal or less-sensitive
      configuration, and then replace this with a more complete one after
      install.</t>

      <t>Addressed a number of comments received before / at IETF104 (Prague).
      These include:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Pointer to
          https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-netconf-zerotouch --
          included reference to (now) RFC8572 (KW)</t>

          <t>Suggested that 802.1AR IDevID (or similar) could be used. Stress
          that this is designed for simplicity (MR)</t>

          <t>Added text to explain that any unique device identifier can be
          used, not just serial number - serial number is simple and easy, but
          anything which is unique (and can be communicated to the customer)
          will work (BF).</t>

          <t>Lots of clarifications from Joe Clarke.</t>

          <t>Make it clear it should first try use the config, and if it
          doesn't work, then try decrypt and use it.</t>

          <t>The CA part was confusing people - the certificate is simply a
          wrapper for the key, and the Subject just an index, and so removed
          that.</t>

          <t>Added a bunch of ASCII diagrams</t>

    <section title="Proof of Concept">
      <t>This section contains a proof of concept of the system.
      It is only intended for illustration, and is not intended to be used
      in production.</t>

      <t>It uses OpenSSL from the command line. In production something more
      automated would be used. In this example, the unique device identifier is the
      serial number of the router, SN19842256.</t>

      <section title="Step 1: Generating the certificate. ">
        <t>This step is performed by the router. It generates a key, then a
        Certificate Signing Request (CSR), and then a self signed certificate.</t>

          -out SN19842256.crt</t>

          <t>The router then sends the key to the vendor&rsquo;s keyserver for
          publication (not shown).</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Step 2: Generating the encrypted configuration. ">
        <t>The operator now wants to deploy the new router.</t>

        <t>They generate the initial configuration (using whatever magic tool
        generates router configs!), fetch the router&rsquo;s certificate and
        encrypt the configuration file to that key. This is done by the operator.</t>

        <section title="Step 2.1: Fetch the certificate.">
          <t>$ wget http://keyserv.example.net/certificates/SN19842256.crt</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Step 2.2: Encrypt the configuration file. ">
          <t>S/MIME is used here because it is simple to demonstrate. This is
          almost definitely not the best way to do this.</t>

      <section title="Step 3: Decrypting and using the configuration. ">
        <t>When the router connects to the operator's network it will detect
        that does not have a valid configuration file, and will start the
        &ldquo;autoboot&rdquo; process. This is a well documented process, but
        the high level overview is that it will use DHCP to obtain an IP
        address and configuration server. It will then use TFTP to download a
        configuration file, based upon its serial number (this document
        modifies the solution to fetch an encrypted configuration file (ending in
        .enc)). It will then decrypt the configuration file, and install it.</t>
